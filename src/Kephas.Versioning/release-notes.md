# Release notes

# 12.0.0

* NEW: Created ```Kephas.Versioning``` package - split from ```Kephas.Abstractions```. ```ActivationException``` and ```ImplementationForAttribute``` to [Kephas.Reflection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kephas.Reflection).
* Breaking change: ```VersionComparer.GetHashCode(version)``` uses now ```System.HashCode``` to compute the version hash code.
