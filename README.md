*Our commitment to innovation*

Kephas Framework ("stone" in aramaic) is a very ambitious project aiming to deliver a framework for an application ecosystem. As its name suggests, it is designed to be a basement for cost-effective and highly productive application development. Some of the key terms addressed:

1. Customizable at each level and in every aspect
2. Aspect oriented / Separation of concerns
3. Multi-dimensional model approach
4. Service oriented
5. Multi-database support (MongoDB, SQL Server, SQL Azure, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, whatever)
6. Localizable
